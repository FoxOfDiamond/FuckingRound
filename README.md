## run the terminal command "node compile.js" to compile both the webgl.ts into browser-friendly js and embed all js files into the compiled html!
- You can also add custom embeds into the index.html file by adding the property 'compilerSrc=${filename}' into any tag, and the content of that file will be inserted into the tag when compiling the html
- "node compile.js o" also opens the compiled html in the browser for convenience's sake
